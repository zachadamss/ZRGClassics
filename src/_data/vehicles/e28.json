      "description": "E28s equipped with the M20 engine (528e) use a timing belt that requires regular replacement. The M20 is an interference engine - if the belt fails, pistons will strike valves causing major engine damage. Factory interval is 60,000 miles but many recommend 50,000 miles for safety. The tensioner and water pump should always be replaced at the same time.",

While chains last longer, the plastic chain guides and tensioner pads deteriorate over time, especially in high-mileage examples. Broken guide pieces can clog the oil pickup. The chain itself stretches with age, affecting timing accuracy.",
