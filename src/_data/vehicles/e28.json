    "overview": "The BMW E28 5 Series (1981-1988) represents BMW's executive sedan during the brand's golden age. Larger and more luxurious than the E30, the E28 offered sophisticated engineering with the M30 inline-six engine, independent suspension, and an elegant Claus Luthe design. The range-topping M5 introduced the world to the super-sedan concept. Today, the E28 offers classic BMW character at more accessible prices than the E30, though finding a rust-free example is increasingly challenging. These cars reward owners who appreciate analog driving dynamics, straightforward maintenance, and understated elegance.",
