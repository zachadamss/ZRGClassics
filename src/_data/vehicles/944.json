With its front-engine, rear-transaxle layout delivering near-perfect 50/50 weight distribution, the 944 offers exceptional handling that rivals much more expensive cars. The 944 Turbo (951) brought serious performance, while the S2 and Turbo S represented the pinnacle of the line. These cars are mechanically robust but require regular maintenance, especially timing belt service. A well-maintained 944 is a genuine driver's car that punches far above its price point.",
