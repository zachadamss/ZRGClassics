      "symptoms": "Rough idle, loss of power at low RPM, engine rattle on cold start, poor fuel economy",
      "description": "The VANOS (Variable Nockenwellen Steuerung) system controls variable valve timing on BMW engines. On the E46, the VANOS seals are made of a rubber compound that degrades over time, causing oil leaks and loss of oil pressure to the VANOS unit. This results in improper valve timing and reduced engine performance.",

      "symptoms": "Overheating, coolant leaks, temperature gauge fluctuation, steam from engine bay",
      "description": "The E46 cooling system uses several plastic components that become brittle with age and heat cycles. The expansion tank, thermostat housing, and water pump impeller are particularly prone to failure. A complete cooling system failure can lead to catastrophic engine damage if the car overheats.",

        "Replace expansion tank (recommended every 60k miles)",

      "description": "A well-documented issue on E46 models, particularly those with higher mileage or that have been driven hard. The rear subframe mounting points can crack the floor pan due to inadequate reinforcement from the factory. This is a serious structural issue that requires professional repair.",

      "description": "The window regulators on the E46 use plastic guides and cables that wear out over time. When the regulator fails, the window can drop suddenly into the door or stop working altogether. This usually affects driver-side windows first due to more frequent use.",
      "fixes": [
