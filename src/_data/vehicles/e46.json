    "overview": "The BMW E46 3 Series (1999-2006) is one of the most popular BMWs ever produced and remains a favorite among enthusiasts. It refined the E36 formula with better build quality, more sophisticated suspension, and improved safety. The E46 M3 with its 333 hp S54 inline-six became an icon of the early 2000s performance car scene. Today, E46s represent excellent value - they're modern enough for daily driving yet old enough to offer an engaging, analog driving experience. However, many E46s have been poorly maintained, modified, or abused, so careful inspection is essential.",
