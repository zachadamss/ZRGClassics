      "description": "The 928's V8 engine is an interference engine that uses a timing belt to drive the camshafts. Belt failure results in piston-to-valve contact and catastrophic engine damage. The 928 has a single belt that drives both camshafts via a complex path around multiple rollers.",

      "description": "The 928 V8 is notorious for oil leaks, primarily from the cam tower (cam cover) gaskets. These gaskets are located at the top of each cylinder bank and seal the camshaft area. They harden with age and heat, causing oil to leak onto the exhaust manifolds.",
