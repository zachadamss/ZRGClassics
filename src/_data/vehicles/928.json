With its front-mounted V8, rear transaxle, and sophisticated rear suspension, the 928 offered continent-crushing performance and luxury. The water-cooled aluminum V8 grew from 4.5L to 5.4L over production, eventually producing 345 hp in the final GTS. The 928 is a complex, sophisticated machine that rewards knowledgeable owners but can punish those who neglect maintenance.
