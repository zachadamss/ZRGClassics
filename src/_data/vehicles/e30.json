Whether you want a practical classic daily driver, a weekend canyon carver, or a track day weapon, the E30 delivers.

      "Convertibles rust more due to water intrusion - inspect very carefully around the top mechanism and rear quarters",
      "Early 1984-1986 cars have different bumpers and trim that are harder to find - later facelift parts (1988+) are more available",
      "The M20 engine is extremely robust when maintained - 300,000+ mile examples exist with proper care",
      "Consider a pre-purchase inspection by an E30 specialist - generic mechanics may miss model-specific issues",
      "Beware of 'M3 clone' cars - legitimate conversions are rare and expensive, most are poorly done",
      "Factor in the cost of period-correct replacement parts - many items are discontinued and expensive",
      "An E30 in solid mechanical condition with rust is often a better buy than a rust-free car with a tired drivetrain - metal work is harder than mechanical repairs"
