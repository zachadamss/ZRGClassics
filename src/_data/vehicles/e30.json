      "symptoms": "Engine won't start, loud slapping noise before failure, visible belt wear or cracking",
      "description": "The M20 (6-cylinder) and M42 (4-cylinder) engines in the E30 use timing belts rather than chains. These belts have a service interval of approximately 50,000 miles, but many recommend replacing them earlier. The M20 is an interference engine, meaning if the belt snaps, the pistons will contact the valves causing catastrophic engine damage.",

      "description": "E30s are notorious for rust, especially in areas with road salt. Common rust spots include the front fenders (behind the wheels), rear wheel arches, rocker panels, battery tray, and floor pans. The trunk floor and spare tire well are also vulnerable. Rust can compromise structural integrity if left untreated.",

Common failure points include the idle control valve (ICV), mass airflow sensor (AFM), coolant temperature sensor, and fuel injectors. Vacuum leaks from aged hoses also cause running issues.
