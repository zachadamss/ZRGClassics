    "overview": "The Porsche 924 (1976-1988) was Porsche's entry-level sports car and introduced the front-engine, rear-transaxle layout that would define the 944 and 968. Originally developed as a joint project with Volkswagen/Audi, the 924 used an Audi-derived inline-four engine that, while not as powerful as purists wanted, provided excellent balance and handling. The 924 Turbo (931) added significant performance and the 924S used the 944's 2.5L engine. Today, the 924 offers genuine Porsche ownership at accessible prices, though finding well-maintained examples requires patience.",
