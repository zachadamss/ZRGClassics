      "description": "The 924's Audi-derived 2.0L inline-4 (and later 2.5L in the 924S) uses a timing belt to drive the camshaft. This is an interference engine, meaning if the belt breaks, the pistons will contact the valves, causing severe engine damage. The 924 Turbo and 924S also require balance shaft belt replacement at the same interval.",
