      "description": "The 991 continues to use plastic coolant pipes in the cooling system. These pipes run from the front radiators to the rear engine and are subjected to heat cycling and vibration. They can crack, especially at connection points, causing coolant loss. The coolant transfer pipe in particular is a known failure point.",

      "symptoms": "Rough idle, misfires, reduced power, poor fuel economy, hesitation under load",
      "description": "All 991 engines use direct fuel injection (DFI), meaning fuel doesn't wash over the intake valves. Carbon deposits accumulate on the valve backs and intake ports, restricting airflow and affecting engine performance. This is a maintenance item requiring periodic walnut blasting, typically every 50,000-80,000 miles depending on driving style.",
