    "overview": "The Porsche 991 (2012-2019) represents the modern evolution of the 911, with increased dimensions, improved technology, and the introduction of turbocharged engines across the range in 991.2. The 991 offers exceptional performance (350-700 hp depending on variant), modern amenities, and excellent reliability. While the naturally aspirated 991.1 engines are praised by purists, the turbocharged 991.2 offers more everyday power. GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 RS variants continue to set benchmarks for track performance.",
