      "symptoms": "Metallic debris in oil, grinding noise from engine, sudden catastrophic engine failure, oil light flickering",
      "description": "The Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing is the most feared issue on the M96 engine used in the 986 Boxster. The bearing supports the intermediate shaft that drives the camshafts. When it fails, metal debris circulates through the engine, causing catastrophic damage. Early cars (1997-1999) with the dual-row bearing are less prone, while 2000-2005 cars with the single-row bearing are at higher risk.",

      "title": "Rear Main Seal (RMS) Leak",
      "symptoms": "Oil drips from bell housing area, oil on clutch (manual), burning oil smell, oil consumption",
      "description": "The rear main seal on the M96 engine is known to leak, especially on higher mileage cars. Oil leaks onto the clutch causing slipping and requiring clutch replacement along with the seal. The RMS is located between the engine and transmission, so the job requires engine or transmission removal.",

      "symptoms": "Sudden coolant loss, overheating, coolant smell, puddle under car, white smoke from engine bay",
      "description": "The 986 uses plastic coolant pipes that run under the intake manifold. These pipes become brittle with age and heat, eventually cracking and causing rapid coolant loss. Because the engine is mid-mounted, overheating can occur quickly without warning.",

      "symptoms": "Rough idle, smoke from exhaust on startup, oil consumption, whistling noise, check engine light",
      "description": "The Air/Oil Separator (AOS) is part of the crankcase ventilation system. It separates oil vapor from air before routing it back to the intake. When the AOS fails (usually the internal diaphragm), it can cause vacuum leaks, allow oil into the intake, and cause rough running.",
      "fixes": [

      "description": "Some M96 engines develop bore scoring - damage to the cylinder walls that allows oil to pass the piston rings. The cause is debated. Bore scoring can range from minor (cosmetic) to severe (engine rebuild required). It's more common on cars that sit for long periods or are driven short distances.",
