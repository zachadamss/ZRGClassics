      "symptoms": "Overheating, coolant leaks, temperature gauge pegged high, steam from engine bay, heater blowing cold",
      "description": "The E36 cooling system is notoriously fragile and one of the most critical maintenance items. BMW used plastic components that become brittle with heat cycles and age. The expansion tank, thermostat housing, water pump impeller, and radiator end tanks are all prone to failure. A cooling system failure can quickly lead to head gasket damage or a warped head.",
      "fixes": [
        "Replace expansion tank every 60,000 miles or at first sign of cracking",
        "Replace thermostat and housing (upgrade to aluminum housing available)",
        "Install water pump with metal impeller (plastic impellers can shatter)",

      "symptoms": "Rough idle, loss of low-end torque, engine rattle at startup, hesitation between 2500-3500 RPM",
      "description": "The E36 with M50TU and M52 engines uses BMW's Single VANOS variable valve timing system. The VANOS unit's seals harden and fail over time, leading to oil leaks and loss of proper valve timing. The VANOS piston seals and the oil supply line seals are the most common failure points.",

      "symptoms": "Clunking from rear over bumps, vague rear-end feel, rear tire wear on inside edge, visible bushing deterioration",
      "description": "The rear trailing arm bushings on the E36 are a well-known weak point. These bushings support the rear suspension and when they wear out, they allow excessive movement of the rear wheels. This affects handling, causes accelerated tire wear, and can make the car feel loose or unpredictable in corners.",
      "fixes": [
        "Replace with OEM rubber bushings (softer ride, will wear again)",
        "Upgrade to polyurethane or Delrin bushings (longer lasting, slightly harsher)",

      "description": "E36 window regulators use plastic clips and guides that fail over time. When the clips break, the window can drop into the door panel. This is especially common on driver's side windows due to more frequent use.",
      "fixes": [
        "Replace entire window regulator assembly",

      "description": "E36s are known for developing oil leaks from several common locations. The valve cover gasket, oil filter housing gasket (OFHG), oil pan gasket, and rear main seal are all common leak points. The OFHG is particularly notorious and can leak onto the serpentine belt.",
      "fixes": [

      "description": "The E36 front suspension uses control arms with pressed-in bushings that wear over time. The lower control arm bushings are the most common failure point. Worn bushings cause imprecise steering, vibration, and accelerated tire wear.",
      "fixes": [
