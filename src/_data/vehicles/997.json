    "overview": "The Porsche 997 (2005-2012) is considered by many to be the best all-around 911 generation - modern enough to be reliable daily drivers yet traditional enough to maintain classic 911 character. The return to round headlights addressed 996 styling criticisms, while the drivetrain evolved from the M96/M97 to the improved 9A1 engine in 2009. The 997 offers exceptional performance (325-620 hp depending on variant) with better reliability than the 996. GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 RS variants are among the most collectible modern Porsches.",
