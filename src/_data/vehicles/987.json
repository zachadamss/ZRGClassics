    "overview": "The Porsche 987 Boxster/Cayman (2005-2012) represents a significant evolution from the 986, with improved styling, more power, and the addition of the Cayman coupe variant. The mid-engine layout delivers exceptional handling, and many consider the Cayman one of the best-handling cars Porsche has ever made. Like the 997, the 987.1 (2005-2008) has IMS bearing concerns while the 987.2 (2009-2012) with DFI engines does not. The Cayman R and Boxster Spyder are particularly desirable.",
