      "symptoms": "Metallic debris in oil filter, grinding/knocking noise, sudden catastrophic engine failure, oil pressure warning",
      "description": "The 996 shares the M96 engine with the Boxster, and thus the same IMS bearing concern. The intermediate shaft bearing can fail without warning, destroying the engine. The 1999-2001 cars with the dual-row bearing have a lower failure rate, while 2002-2005 cars with the single-row bearing are at higher risk. The 996 Turbo and GT3 use different engines and are NOT affected by IMS issues.",

      "symptoms": "Ticking/knocking noise (especially when cold), excessive oil consumption, smoke on startup, low compression on specific cylinders",
      "description": "Bore scoring in the M96 engine is caused by debris damaging the cylinder walls, allowing oil past the piston rings. \"D-Chunk\" refers to a failure mode where a piece of the cylinder wall breaks away. Cylinders 5 and 6 are most commonly affected. This is distinct from IMS failure but equally serious.",
