The new M96 flat-six offered more power (300-381 hp) with better efficiency and refinement. The 996 introduced the controversial 'fried egg' headlights but also brought significant advances in performance and technology. Values have historically been depressed due to the IMS bearing issue, but clean, well-maintained examples are now being recognized as excellent values.
