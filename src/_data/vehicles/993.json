With its completely redesigned multilink rear suspension, the 993 finally tamed the 911's notorious handling quirks while maintaining the visceral air-cooled experience. The Varioram-equipped 3.6L engine produces 272-282 hp in naturally aspirated form, while the twin-turbo models make 400-450 hp. The 993 has become the most collectible modern 911, with prices far exceeding those of newer water-cooled models.",
