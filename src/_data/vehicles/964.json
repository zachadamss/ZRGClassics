      "symptoms": "Oil spots under car, oil on engine surfaces, visible seepage, low oil level, burning oil smell",
      "description": "The 964's M64 engine is notorious for oil leaks. The most common source is the chain housing gasket (timing chain cover), but oil also seeps from the case half seams, valve cover gaskets, oil cooler seals, and cam tower o-rings. While some seepage is considered normal for air-cooled engines, excessive leaks require attention.",

      "symptoms": "Clutch chatter, vibration at idle in gear, rattling noise, difficulty engaging gears",
      "description": "The 964 was the first 911 to use a dual-mass flywheel (DMF) to smooth out the flat-six's inherent vibration. These flywheels have internal springs and dampers that wear out over time, causing chatter and vibration. A failed DMF can also damage the clutch and transmission input shaft bearing.",

The distributor drive gears (plastic in early cars) can strip. Moisture intrusion causes cap corrosion and misfires. The dual-distributor system is complex but essential for the engine's operation.",

      "description": "The 964 uses the Getrag G50 5-speed transmission. While generally robust, the synchros wear over time, especially second gear. Aggressive driving, improper fluid, and inadequate warm-up accelerate wear. A worn synchro will grind or block when trying to engage the affected gear.",
