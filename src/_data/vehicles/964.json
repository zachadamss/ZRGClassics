While maintaining the classic air-cooled flat-six and rear-engine layout, the 964 added coil-spring suspension, power steering, ABS brakes, and available all-wheel drive (Carrera 4). The 3.6L engine produced 247-315 hp depending on variant. The 964 is often considered the last of the 'classic' 911s while offering more refinement than earlier models.
