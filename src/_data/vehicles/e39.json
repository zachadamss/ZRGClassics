    "overview": "The BMW E39 5 Series (1997-2003) is widely considered the best 5 Series ever made and one of the greatest sports sedans in automotive history. It combined sophisticated engineering, exceptional build quality, and a perfect balance of performance and comfort. The E39 M5 with its 4.9L S62 V8 producing 394 hp became an instant legend. Today, E39s offer incredible value - a refined, capable, and genuinely enjoyable driving experience at depreciated prices. However, these are complex German cars now 20+ years old, and maintenance costs can escalate quickly on neglected examples.",
