            <h3>Timing Belt Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Engine won't start, catastrophic engine noise, bent valves, visible belt damage through inspection hole</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's V8 engine (M28 in early cars, later variations through the S4 and GTS) is an interference engine that uses a timing belt to drive the camshafts. Belt failure results in piston-to-valve contact and catastrophic engine damage. The 928 has a single belt that drives both camshafts via a complex path around multiple rollers. The belt service is more complex than on the 944 due to the V8 configuration. Original service interval was 60,000 miles, but 30,000-40,000 miles or 4 years is the modern recommendation due to belt age degradation.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace timing belt every 30,000-40,000 miles or 4 years (whichever first)</li>
                    <li>Replace ALL timing belt rollers and tensioner (multiple rollers on V8)</li>
                    <li>Replace water pump at the same time</li>

            <h3>Cam Tower Gasket and Oil Leaks</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Oil leaks at top of engine, burning oil smell, oil on exhaust manifolds, low oil level, smoke from engine bay</p>
            <p class="description">The 928 V8 is notorious for oil leaks, primarily from the cam tower (cam cover) gaskets. These gaskets are located at the top of each cylinder bank and seal the camshaft area. They harden with age and heat, causing oil to leak onto the exhaust manifolds, creating smoke and fire risk. The valve cover gaskets (above the cam towers) also leak. Additionally, the cylinder head gaskets, oil pan gasket, and various other seals deteriorate. A leaking 928 is the norm rather than the exception for high-mileage cars.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace cam tower gaskets with updated Porsche gaskets</li>
                    <li>Replace valve cover gaskets at the same time</li>
                    <li>Inspect and replace cylinder head gaskets if leaking</li>
                    <li>Replace rear main seal if leaking (requires transmission removal)</li>
                    <li>Replace oil pan gasket if leaking</li>
                    <li>Replace all oil cooler lines and seals</li>
                    <li>Use proper torque specifications to avoid gasket damage</li>

            <h3>Engine Wiring Harness Deterioration</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Random misfires, check engine light, running issues, no-start conditions, sensors not reading correctly</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's engine wiring harness is routed through a hot area near the engine and uses insulation that becomes brittle and cracks with age and heat. This is especially problematic on S4 and later models with more complex engine management. Cracked insulation causes short circuits, intermittent connections, and ground faults that create a wide variety of drivability issues. Diagnosing electrical problems becomes extremely difficult when the harness is deteriorated, as multiple faults can occur.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspect harness for cracked or brittle insulation</li>
                    <li>Rewrap harness with proper heat-resistant tape or conduit</li>
                    <li>Repair individual broken wires with proper soldering and heat shrink</li>
                    <li>Replace entire engine wiring harness (rebuilt harnesses available from specialists)</li>
                    <li>Add heat shielding to protect new harness from exhaust heat</li>
                    <li>Clean and protect all electrical connectors with dielectric grease</li>

            <h3>Automatic Transmission Issues</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping, delayed engagement, no movement in gear, fluid leaks, overheating warning</p>
            <p class="description">Most 928s were sold with automatic transmissions (Mercedes 4-speed or later Aisin-Warner 4-speed). These transmissions are generally robust but require proper maintenance and develop problems with age. Common issues include worn valve body, torque converter failure, and failed seals causing leaks. The transmission operates at high temperatures and requires proper cooling. Overheating from a failed cooler or clogged lines can cause rapid transmission failure. The transmission shares fluid with the torque tube.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular fluid and filter changes (every 30,000 miles)</li>
                    <li>Flush transmission cooler and lines</li>
                    <li>Replace transmission cooler if clogged or leaking</li>
                    <li>Rebuild or replace valve body for shift quality issues</li>
                    <li>Replace torque converter if shuddering or failing to lock up</li>
                    <li>Full transmission rebuild for severe issues</li>
                    <li>Use correct Mercedes or Porsche-spec ATF</li>

            <h3>Cooling System Failures</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, white smoke from tailpipe, heater not working, temperature gauge fluctuation</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's V8 produces significant heat and relies on a complex cooling system. The water pump, driven by the timing belt, is a common failure point. The radiator's plastic end tanks crack with age. The thermostat can fail open or closed. Coolant hoses, now 25-45 years old, become brittle and collapse internally. The heater core, buried in the dashboard, can leak or clog. Head gasket failure, while less common, can cause coolant consumption and overheating.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace water pump with every timing belt service</li>
                    <li>Replace thermostat with OEM temperature rating</li>
                    <li>Replace radiator if plastic tanks are cracking or leaking</li>
                    <li>Replace all coolant hoses (including heater hoses)</li>
                    <li>Flush cooling system and use proper G05 or Porsche-spec coolant</li>
                    <li>Check and clean electric cooling fan operation</li>
                    <li>Pressure test system to find hidden leaks</li>

            <h3>Vacuum System Deterioration</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Climate control not working, doors won't lock, cruise control failure, rough idle, brake booster issues</p>
            <p class="description">The 928 uses vacuum to power many systems including HVAC controls, door locks (on early cars), cruise control, and brake booster. Over 25-45 years, the vacuum hoses become brittle and crack, causing leaks. The vacuum reservoir and check valves can fail. Vacuum leaks cause a cascade of seemingly unrelated failures - non-functional climate control, door locks that don't work, and rough running from unmetered air entering the engine. Tracking down vacuum leaks is a common diagnostic challenge on 928s.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace all vacuum hoses throughout the car</li>
                    <li>Check and replace vacuum reservoir if cracked</li>
                    <li>Replace vacuum check valves</li>
                    <li>Test vacuum actuators in doors and HVAC system</li>
                    <li>Replace brake booster check valve if brakes feel hard</li>
                    <li>Use proper vacuum line material (silicone hose for engine, rubber for interior)</li>
                    <li>Create vacuum diagram documentation for future reference</li>

            <h3>Weissach Axle Suspension Wear (S4/GTS)</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Rear-end wander, unpredictable handling at limit, clunking from rear, uneven rear tire wear</p>
            <p class="description">Later 928 models (S4, GT, GTS) use the Weissach rear axle, a sophisticated multi-link suspension that provides passive rear-wheel steering for improved handling. The system uses multiple bushings and control arms that wear over time. Worn Weissach axle components cause unpredictable handling characteristics that undermine the car's exceptional dynamics. The system's complexity makes diagnosis and repair more involved than a conventional rear suspension.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspect all Weissach axle bushings for wear</li>
                    <li>Replace control arm bushings (polyurethane or OEM rubber available)</li>
                    <li>Replace toe links and trailing arm bushings</li>
                    <li>Check wheel bearings for play</li>
                    <li>Rebuild or replace control arms if ball joints are worn</li>
                    <li>Perform full rear alignment after suspension work</li>

            <h3>Pop-Up Headlight Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Headlights stuck up or down, slow headlight operation, one headlight won't open, motor noise but no movement</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's distinctive pop-up headlights are operated by electric motors driving cables and linkages. The motors can fail, the cables can break or stretch, and the plastic linkage components can crack. The headlight pods themselves can stick due to dried lubricant or damaged pivot points. When the headlights fail, they typically fail in the down position, leaving you without headlights - a safety concern.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>

            <h3>Instrument Cluster and Electronics</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Dead or flickering gauges, inaccurate readings, warning lights stuck on, odometer failure, dim display</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's instrument cluster is a complex electronic unit with multiple displays and warning systems. The circuits board develops solder cracks from thermal cycling. Capacitors fail with age. The LCD displays (on later models) can fade or fail. The odometer uses the same plastic gear issue as the 944. The 928 also has early electronic systems for climate control and trip computer that develop problems with age. Finding a fully functional 928 cluster is increasingly difficult.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>

            <h3>Air Conditioning System Failures</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: No cold air, weak airflow, hot on one side and cold on the other, clicking from dashboard, refrigerant leaks</p>
            <p class="description">The 928's automatic climate control system was advanced for its time but is now 25-45 years old. The compressor, condenser, and evaporator all wear out. The early R12 systems have been converted to R134a, often improperly. The servo motors that control temperature blend doors fail, causing temperature issues. The heater core can leak. The system uses vacuum to control some functions, adding to potential failure points. Many 928s have non-functional or poorly functioning A/C.</p>
