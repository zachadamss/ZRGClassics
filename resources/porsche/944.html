        <p class="subtitle">Common issues, symptoms, and solutions for the 944 platform</p>

        <article class="issue-card">
            <h3>Timing Belt and Balance Shaft Belt Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Engine won't start, catastrophic engine noise, bent valves, snapped belt visible through timing cover inspection hole</p>
            <p class="description">The 944's 2.5L (and 2.7L/3.0L in later S and S2 models) inline-4 is an interference engine that relies on timing and balance shaft belts. If either belt fails, the valves will contact the pistons, requiring an engine rebuild or replacement. This is the most critical maintenance item on the 944. The balance shafts reduce engine vibration and their belt must be replaced with the timing belt. Many 944s have been destroyed by owners or mechanics unfamiliar with the dual-belt system. Original service interval was 30,000 miles, but modern recommendations are every 30,000 miles or 4 years maximum.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace BOTH timing belt AND balance shaft belt every 30,000 miles or 4 years</li>
                    <li>Replace timing belt tensioner and rollers (failure here also kills the engine)</li>
                    <li>Replace water pump (driven by timing belt, not accessible otherwise)</li>
                    <li>Replace all timing belt area seals (camshaft, balance shaft, crankshaft)</li>
                    <li>Use only high-quality belts (OEM, Gates, Continental)</li>
                    <li>On S2/Turbo: ensure all roller tensioners are replaced (they use more rollers)</li>
                    <li>Never buy a 944 without documented timing belt history</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Water Pump Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Coolant leak at front of engine, overheating, squealing noise from engine, play in water pump shaft</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 water pump is driven by the timing belt and located behind the timing covers. When the pump bearings or seals fail, coolant leaks externally or, worse, internally into the timing belt area where it can contaminate and weaken the belt. Because accessing the water pump requires complete timing belt removal, it should always be replaced during belt service. Water pump failure between belt services can lead to overheating or a contaminated timing belt that fails prematurely.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>ALWAYS replace water pump with timing belt service</li>
                    <li>Use OEM or quality metal-impeller pump (avoid plastic impeller pumps)</li>
                    <li>Replace thermostat at the same time</li>
                    <li>If pump failed between services, inspect timing belt for contamination</li>
                    <li>Replace coolant with proper G05 or Porsche-spec coolant</li>
                    <li>Pressure test cooling system after repair</li>

            <h3>DME Relay Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: No-start condition, fuel pump doesn't prime, car dies while driving and won't restart, intermittent starting issues</p>
            <p class="description">The DME (Digital Motor Electronics) relay is an infamous weak point on all 944s. This relay controls power to the fuel pump, fuel injectors, and engine management computer. The relay uses solder joints that crack over time from thermal cycling, causing intermittent or complete failure. The car may start fine when cold but fail when hot, or may die while driving and refuse to start until cooled down. The relay is located in the fuse box area under the dashboard.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace DME relay with new OEM unit (brown relay, Porsche P/N varies by year)</li>
                    <li>Avoid cheap aftermarket relays - they often fail quickly</li>
                    <li>Some owners re-solder the original relay as a temporary fix</li>
                    <li>Carry a spare relay in the glove box (common advice for 944 owners)</li>
                    <li>Clean relay socket contacts while relay is out</li>
                    <li>Check for corrosion in fuse box area that may affect relay operation</li>

            <h3>Clutch Hydraulic System Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Clutch pedal goes to floor, soft or spongy pedal, difficulty shifting, clutch won't disengage, fluid leak at master or slave cylinder</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 uses a hydraulic clutch system with a master cylinder at the pedal and a slave cylinder at the transaxle. Both cylinders use rubber seals that deteriorate over time, causing internal and external leaks. The clutch line can also develop leaks. When the system fails, the clutch won't fully disengage, making shifting difficult or impossible. Because the transaxle is at the rear, bleeding the system properly is critical - air bubbles will cause spongy operation.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace clutch master cylinder (located under dashboard, driver's side)</li>
                    <li>Replace clutch slave cylinder (at transaxle bell housing)</li>
                    <li>Replace clutch hydraulic line if deteriorated</li>
                    <li>Bleed system thoroughly (use pressure bleeder for best results)</li>
                    <li>Use DOT 4 brake fluid (same fluid as brake system)</li>
                    <li>Consider replacing both master and slave together as preventive maintenance</li>

            <h3>Torque Tube Bearing Wear</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Vibration at certain speeds, humming or growling noise from center of car, vibration when accelerating or decelerating</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 uses a torque tube to connect the front-mounted engine to the rear-mounted transaxle. The torque tube contains the driveshaft and uses a center support bearing (also called carrier bearing or torque tube bearing). This sealed bearing wears over time, causing vibrations and noise. Severe wear can damage the torque tube itself. The torque tube is a sealed unit from the factory, so bearing replacement requires disassembly of the tube.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace torque tube center support bearing</li>
                    <li>Inspect CV joints at both ends of the driveshaft (flex discs at front, CV at rear)</li>
                    <li>Replace flex disc (guibo) at engine end if cracked or deteriorated</li>
                    <li>Replace rear CV joint if worn (often done at same time as clutch)</li>
                    <li>Have torque tube serviced by specialist if unfamiliar with procedure</li>
                    <li>Check torque tube tube itself for damage if bearing was severely worn</li>

            <h3>Dashboard Cracking</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Cracks appearing on dashboard surface, especially on top near windshield, warping, deteriorating texture</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 dashboard is made of foam covered with vinyl and is extremely prone to cracking, especially in hot climates or when exposed to direct sunlight. UV exposure causes the vinyl to shrink and crack, often creating multiple deep fissures across the dashboard top. This is primarily a cosmetic issue but affects the value and appearance of the car significantly. Cracked dashboards are nearly universal on 944s that haven't been protected.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dashboard cover or cap (covers damage but changes appearance)</li>
                    <li>Professional dashboard restoration (fills and re-textures surface)</li>
                    <li>Replacement with used dashboard (if you can find one in good condition)</li>
                    <li>Custom dashboard replacement panels (aftermarket options available)</li>
                    <li>Prevention: always use sunshade when parked, apply UV protectant</li>
                    <li>Note: NOS dashboards are extremely rare and expensive</li>

            <h3>Power Steering Rack Leaks</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Power steering fluid leak, low fluid in reservoir, heavy steering when cold, whining from power steering pump</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 power steering rack commonly develops leaks from the seals as they age. Leaks typically occur at the pinion seal, tie rod end seals, or pressure line connections. Low fluid levels cause the pump to whine and can damage the pump if run dry. The rack is located low in the front of the car and is exposed to road debris and moisture, accelerating seal deterioration.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rebuild steering rack with new seals (seal kits available)</li>
                    <li>Replace steering rack with rebuilt or new unit</li>
                    <li>Replace power steering lines if leaking at fittings</li>
                    <li>Replace power steering pump if damaged from running low on fluid</li>
                    <li>Use correct ATF or Porsche-specified power steering fluid</li>
                    <li>Replace tie rod ends while rack is out (saves labor later)</li>

            <h3>Odometer and Speedometer Gear Failure</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Odometer stops working while speedometer works, intermittent odometer, trip meter stuck</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 (and 924/928) instrument cluster uses plastic gears to drive the odometer from the speedometer. These gears strip or crack with age, causing the odometer to stop functioning while the speedometer continues to work. This is a common issue on German cars of this era using VDO clusters. The trip meter uses the same gear train and typically fails at the same time.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace odometer gears with aftermarket repair kit (brass gears available)</li>
                    <li>Have instrument cluster professionally rebuilt</li>
                    <li>Replace entire cluster with functional used unit (keep original for documentation)</li>
                    <li>When selling, disclose odometer not working and actual mileage if known</li>
                    <li>This is a common DIY repair with proper instructions and patience</li>
                    <li>Note: rolling back odometers is illegal - repair should restore true function</li>

            <h3>Engine Mount Deterioration</h3>
            <p class="symptoms">Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, engine moves visibly during acceleration/deceleration, clunking when shifting, harsh NVH</p>
            <p class="description">The 944 engine is mounted to the chassis with rubber mounts that deteriorate over time. The large inline-4 engine with balance shafts puts significant stress on these mounts. When worn, the engine moves excessively, causing vibrations to transfer to the chassis and creating clunking noises during load changes. Severely worn mounts can affect the timing belt tension and engine alignment with the torque tube.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <h4>Common Fixes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace engine mounts with OEM rubber mounts</li>
                    <li>Consider polyurethane mounts for performance use (more NVH, longer life)</li>
                    <li>Replace transaxle mounts at the same time (similar deterioration)</li>
                    <li>Check and replace torque tube mounts if worn</li>
                    <li>Inspect motor mount bolt condition and replace if stretched/worn</li>
